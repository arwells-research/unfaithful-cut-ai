\section{Empirical Illustration: A Minimal Offline-RL Setting}

This appendix provides a deliberately minimal empirical-style illustration of the diagnostic in a
simple control environment. The purpose is feasibility rather than performance: to illustrate, in a setting that
resembles offline reinforcement learning, how an unfaithful cut can exist even when
observational evaluation appears complete. The example is post-hoc and explanatory; it
does not propose a deployable detection procedure.

This illustration is intentionally minimal. Its role is not to demonstrate scalability
or benchmark performance, but to establish a lower bound: that the epistemic failure
identified by the unfaithful cut arises even in the simplest offline RL–like settings.
Larger or more realistic benchmarks (e.g., MuJoCo or D4RL-style tasks) may amplify the
phenomenon but do not alter its nature, since observational evaluation alone cannot
certify interventional reliability when interface-level distinctions are collapsed.

The example is deliberately minimal. It isolates the representational failure diagnosed
by the unfaithful cut while abstracting away issues of function approximation, sample
efficiency, or optimization. More complex environments amplify the same phenomenon but
are not required to exhibit it. Crucially, the failure illustrated here is invisible under the logged data distribution:
no amount of additional observational data collected under the behavior policy would
reveal the impending intervention failure.

\subsection{Environment}

Consider a two-step environment with observations $o \in \{0,1\}$, actions
$a \in \{0,1\}$, and an unobserved mode variable $m \in \{0,1\}$ that persists for the
episode. The mode is sampled at the start of each episode with
$P(m{=}0)=P(m{=}1)=\tfrac{1}{2}$. The agent observes $o_0=0$ initially in all episodes.

At time $t=0$, the agent chooses action $a_0$ and receives the next observation $o_1$
according to:
\[
P(o_1 = 1 \mid o_0=0, a_0=0, m)=\tfrac{1}{2}, \qquad
P(o_1 = 1 \mid o_0=0, a_0=1, m)=\mathbb{I}[m=1].
\]
Intuitively, action $a_0=0$ produces an observation that is uninformative about the latent
mode, while action $a_0=1$ reveals it perfectly.

\subsection{A Predictively Adequate Reduction}

Suppose a model is trained only on logged data collected by a behavior policy that
overwhelmingly selects $a_0=0$ (e.g., $P_{\beta}(a_0=0)=0.99$). Under this logging policy,
the conditional distribution of $o_1$ is approximately:
\[
P_{\beta}(o_1=1 \mid o_0=0) \approx \tfrac{1}{2}.
\]
A reduced representation that retains only the current observation,
\[
\pi(h) := o_0,
\]
is therefore observationally adequate for predicting logged outcomes at the model
interface. It matches the observed distribution of $o_1$ under the behavior policy
without representing the latent mode $m$.

This mirrors a common offline RL pattern: the model appears reliable because the data
collection policy does not excite the dynamics that would reveal hidden distinctions.
Predictive evaluation alone provides no signal that the reduction is unsafe.

\subsection{Intervention Failure Under a Policy Change}

Now consider a deployment-time intervention corresponding to a policy change in which
the agent selects $a_0=1$ at the same interface state $o_0=0$. Under this intervention,
the next observation becomes mode-dependent:
\[
P(o_1=1 \mid o_0=0, a_0=1, m=0)=0, \qquad
P(o_1=1 \mid o_0=0, a_0=1, m=1)=1.
\]
Two episodes that are indistinguishable at the interface (same $o_0=0$) but differ in
latent history ($m$) now produce disjoint outcome distributions. Any model whose interface
representation collapses these histories must assign the same prediction to both and is
therefore necessarily wrong for at least one mode.

This constitutes an unfaithful cut: the reduction is closed under prediction for the
logged distribution but not closed under intervention induced by a policy change.

\subsection{Applying the Diagnostic}

We apply the diagnostic from Section~6.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
  \item \textbf{Identify the model interface.} The model conditions only on $o_0$.
  \item \textbf{Identify interface-equivalence classes.} All trajectories that reach
        $o_0=0$ are equivalent at the interface, regardless of latent $m$.
  \item \textbf{Specify admissible interventions.} The deployment system permits action
        $a_0=1$ at $o_0=0$, corresponding to a policy change within the action set.
  \item \textbf{Check whether the intervention separates interface-equivalent
        trajectories.} Under $a_0=1$, the outcome distributions differ maximally across
        modes.
\end{enumerate}

The diagnostic therefore characterizes an unfaithful cut in this setting: the interface
collapses trajectories that admissible actions can later separate. This characterization
does not rely on predictive error, but on reasoning about interventions outside the
observed data distribution.

\subsection{Notes on Stochastic Separation and Practical Scaling}

This example also illustrates the stochastic form of separation. In general, admissible
interventions may separate trajectories by inducing different outcome distributions
rather than deterministic divergence. Any systematic post-intervention distributional
difference over interface observations indicates that the representation has erased
intervention-relevant distinctions.

In larger or continuous systems, exact evaluation of separation may be infeasible.
However, the same diagnostic logic applies. Sampling-based checks, stress-testing under policy perturbations, or divergence estimates
over post-intervention rollouts can provide suggestive evidence of unfaithful cuts, but do
not eliminate the underlying epistemic limitation: absent intervention or additional
assumptions, observational data alone cannot certify intervention faithfulness. This
example demonstrates feasibility rather than completeness and is intended to illustrate
how the diagnostic extends naturally to offline reinforcement learning settings.

These stochastic illustrations are intended to demonstrate the form the diagnostic takes
in noisy settings, not to provide a complete formal treatment; developing general
statistical guarantees for stochastic intervention separation remains an open problem.
